# UT Austin Internship
Code written for my summer of 2022 internship at UT Austin (6/22/22 - 7/27/22)

## test1 (6/22/22)
First task given to test abilities: take a large .csv file containing data and restructuring it into a given format. Used [OpenCSV](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net) library. (Note: neither the data or the output are tracked in this repo because their filesizes are too large.)
